 Collect historical data for preprocessing.
 Data profiling done followed by missing data treatment and outliers
 Perform EDA to gain insights into the data, identify trends, correlations. Then preprocessing 
done for normalization
 Visualize data patterns and distributions to inform feature selection and model development.
 Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate model training and 
evaluation.
 Implemented different Machine learning model like Logistic regression, KNN, Linear 
regression, Decision tree, Random forest, AdaBoost. Evaluate model performance
 Used cross validation techniques to assess model generation
 Selected the best-performing machine learning model based on evaluation results.
 Deployed the selected model in a production environment like AWS (EC2 instance)
